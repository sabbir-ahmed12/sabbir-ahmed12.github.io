        - Machine-Learning Based Speaker Identification System Using Cochleagram.
        - title: Objectives
          contents:
            - To build a speaker identification (SID) system that provides consistent performance for different noises at various levels of SNR.
            - To make a robust SID system for text-dependent as well as text-independent dataset.
            - To evaluate the variation of the system's performance for reverberated speech as well as distorted speech.

          contents:
            The process of recognizing someone based on oneâ€™s voice is called speaker identification
            (SID). Speech signals being susceptible to significant variations, SID is a quite challenging
            task and conventional speaker identification systems does not perform well under different
            noisy environments. Also, reverberant conditions, recording quality and transmission method
            aggravate the problem. In this study, a robust system for SID is proposed using an
            auditory-inspired feature called cochleagram. Cochleagrams were generated using gammatone
            filterbank having 128 channels from frequency 50 to 8000Hz. Cochleagrams constructed from
            clean and a particular noise added over speech samples at a certain SNR were used to train
            a convolutional neural network (CNN) referred to as noise adapted CNN. The proposed model
            was then tested for 9 other different noises at different level of SNRs to measure the accuracy in
            mismatched conditions. Experimental results showed that the identification accuracy obtained
            from the proposed system is akin to that of the existing speaker identification (SID) systems.
            However, the proposed system showed quite better performance than existing neurogram based
            methods under noisy conditions particularly at very low SNRs for text-dependent as well as
            text-independent corpus.
